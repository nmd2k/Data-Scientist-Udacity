**What Kinds of Places Can You Rent in Seattle?**

Seattle’s Airbnb options are diverse, ranging from cozy rooms to entire houses. After analyzing the distribution of property types, we found that apartments dominate the market, followed by houses. It makes sense, given that Seattle’s urban core is dense with apartment complexes, but there’s still a decent chunk of larger homes available for rent.
