# Sparkify Project

## Project Overview
Sparkify is a music streaming service project that analyzes user behavior data to predict customer churn. Using Apache Spark, this project processes and analyzes user log data to identify patterns that indicate when users are likely to cancel their service.

The main findings of the code can be found at the [Medium Blog post for explaining](https://nmd2k.medium.com/sparkify-predicting-churn-with-big-data-magic-73e1c73ab50b) the technical details of my project. A Random Forest Classifier was chosen to be the best model by evaluating F1 score and accuracy metrics. The final model achieved an F1 and Accuracy score of 0.88.

## Project Description
The project aims to analysis a music streaming platform name Sparikify. By analyzing user interaction data through Apache Spark's big data capabilities, I try to use ML model to predict when users are likely to cancel their subscriptions.

The notebook contain:
1. Data Loading and Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training and Evaluation
